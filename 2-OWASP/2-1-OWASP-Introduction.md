### 1. **Introduction to OWASP**

- **What is OWASP?**
  - OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a non-profit foundation with the goal of improving the security of software.
  - The foundation is **voluntarily run**, and anyone can become a member of OWASP.

- **Common Misunderstanding**
  - The phrase "be familiar with OWASP" that you may see on job adverts is a bit misleading.
  - When job ads say you need to be "familiar with OWASP," what they likely mean is that you need to be familiar with specific **OWASP projects**, not just the foundation itself.
