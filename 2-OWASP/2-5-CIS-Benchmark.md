### CIS Benchmarks

**CIS Benchmarks** are configuration guidelines developed by **CIS (Center for Internet Security)**. CIS is a **non-profit organization** focused on securing organizations against **cyber threats**.

#### Purpose of CIS Benchmarks:
CIS Benchmarks are designed to provide **security configuration guidelines** for a wide variety of products, including:
- **Software**
- **Operating systems**
- **Networked devices**
- **Mobile devices**, and more.

The benchmarks are used to ensure that products are configured securely to mitigate the risk of cyber threats. They are highly useful for anyone working in security roles, such as **DevSecOps**, as they provide detailed, tested, and best-practice configuration recommendations.

#### Why CIS Benchmarks Are Important:
- **Ease of use**: Instead of relying solely on your own knowledge or best guesses, you can use the CIS Benchmarks as a **checklist** to validate configurations. For example, if a colleague builds a **vanilla Windows server** and asks for verification of its security hardening, you can use the **CIS Windows Server Benchmark** to check whether the server has been configured correctly.
- **Checklist format**: These benchmarks serve as a **step-by-step guide** that makes it easier to ensure configurations follow security best practices.

#### Levels of CIS Benchmarks:
CIS Benchmarks are categorized into **two levels**:
1. **Level 1**: Focuses on security configurations that **won't impact usability** significantly. These are typically foundational security controls.
2. **Level 2**: More detailed and may involve configurations that **could affect usability** but are aimed at increasing the security posture of the system.

Both levels of benchmarks offer a **tiered approach** to security, allowing organizations to implement security controls based on their risk tolerance and operational needs.

#### CIS Hardened Images:
CIS also provides **pre-hardened images** for cloud environments. For example, **Azure** users can deploy a **pre-hardened Windows server image** that is already configured to adhere to CIS Benchmarks.
- This saves time, as you do not need to manually configure security settings for the server from scratch.
- You can deploy a **level 1 hardened image** straight out of the box, ensuring that your server meets the baseline security controls recommended by CIS.

#### Tools for Automation:
To simplify the process of testing configurations against the CIS Benchmarks, **tools** have been developed to automate the verification.
- Instead of manually going through the benchmarks to check each configuration, these tools will **automatically test your system** against the relevant benchmarks.
- While using these tools saves time and reduces the chance of human error, **reading through the benchmarks** manually is still a valuable exercise for learning how systems should be securely configured.

#### Conclusion:
CIS Benchmarks are a vital resource for ensuring that systems are securely configured and hardened. They provide structured, **industry-standard guidelines** that help improve the security of operating systems, software, and devices. By following these benchmarks, you can be confident that your systems are configured to withstand common cyber threats.
