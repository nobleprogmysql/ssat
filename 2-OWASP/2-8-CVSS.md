### **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**

**What is CVSS?**

- **CVSS** stands for **Common Vulnerability Scoring System**.
- It is a **standard** used to assess the severity of **security vulnerabilities**.

**Purpose of CVSS:**

- CVSS provides a **score** that indicates the severity of a vulnerability.
- This score is calculated based on a set of metrics.

**Metrics for Calculation:**

- There are various **metrics** that contribute to the calculation of the CVSS score.
- You can use the **CVSS calculator** available on the [first.org website](https://www.first.org) to see how each metric impacts the final score.

---

### **CVSS Scoring Range**

- The CVSS score ranges from **0 to 10**, with one decimal place.
- Based on this score, vulnerabilities are categorized into different severity levels:

  - **Low**: 0.1 to 3.9
  - **Medium**: 4.0 to 6.9
  - **High**: 7.0 to 8.9
  - **Critical**: 9.0 to 10.0

### **Understanding CVSS Calculation**

- You don’t necessarily need to dive deep into the exact calculation, but it's useful to know that the CVSS score helps determine how severe a vulnerability is.
- **Key takeaway**: You can use the CVSS calculator to determine a score for a specific vulnerability.

---

### **CVSS and CVEs**

- **CVEs** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) use **CVSS** to determine their **severity rating**.
- CVSS is the system that provides a standardized score for each CVE based on its severity.

---

### **Example of CVSS Calculation**

- Here is a screenshot of the **CVSS calculator**.
- Some example metrics that impact the score include:
  - **Attack Vector**: This is a critical metric.
    - If a vulnerability can be exploited **over the network**, it will have a higher score, meaning it’s more dangerous than vulnerabilities that require **physical access** to exploit.

---

### **Conclusion**

- CVSS is an essential tool for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities.
- By using CVSS, security teams can prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity, helping them focus on the most critical issues first.
