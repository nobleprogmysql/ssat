### OWASP Top 10

The **OWASP Top 10** is a document containing the **ten most critical security concerns for web application security**. It is released every few years, and historical releases have been made in the following years: **2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2017, and 2021**.

The document provides a ranking from 1 to 10, highlighting the most common and severe security risks in web applications. Keep in mind that rankings can change from year to year. Some risks may go up or down in ranking, while others may leave or be replaced. However, the issues generally remain similar year-to-year.

### Current OWASP Top 10 (2021)

As of 2021, here are the top 10 security risks for web applications:

#### 1. **Broken Access Control**
   - **Definition**: This refers to scenarios where users are able to perform actions outside of their intended permissions.
   - **Impact**: Failures in access control can lead to unauthorized access, information disclosure, and data modification.
   - **Example**: If non-admin users can access admin functionalities, it constitutes broken access control.

#### 2. **Cryptographic Failures**
   - **Definition**: This involves failures related to cryptography or a complete lack of it, which can lead to exposure of sensitive data.
   - **Example**: Using **SSLv3** (which is deprecated) instead of **TLS 1.2 or 1.3**. SSLv3 is vulnerable to attacks like **POODLE**, so it is no longer considered secure.

#### 3. **Injection**
   - **Definition**: This occurs when unvalidated or improperly validated user input allows attackers to inject malicious code into an application.
   - **Impact**: Types of injection attacks include **SQL injection**, **command injection**, and **XPath injection**.
   - **Example**: An attacker can exploit a **login page** to inject malicious code, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
   - **Security Tip**: Never trust user input; always validate it both client-side and server-side. However, client-side validation can be bypassed, so server-side validation is the most important.

#### 4. **Insecure Design**
   - **Definition**: This refers to weaknesses that arise from insecure application design.
   - **Impact**: If the application is designed insecurely from the beginning, it becomes difficult to implement proper security controls.
   - **Example**: Not having a **secure development lifecycle (SDLC)** or secure coding practices in place, making it hard to design and implement secure applications.

#### 5. **Security Misconfiguration**
   - **Definition**: This is when an application, server, or service is misconfigured, leading to security vulnerabilities.
   - **Example**: Using default credentials (e.g., **admin/admin**) or not hardening systems by disabling unnecessary services, ports, and accounts.

#### 6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
   - **Definition**: This involves using outdated or insecure software components that may have known vulnerabilities.
   - **Example**: Running a web server on an outdated operating system like **Windows XP** or using old, unsupported libraries with known vulnerabilities (e.g., libraries or frameworks with unpatched CVEs).
   - **Security Tip**: Ensure all components are kept up-to-date, and regularly patch known vulnerabilities.

#### 7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**
   - **Definition**: This category includes weaknesses in the identification and authentication mechanisms used by an application.
   - **Example**: Lack of **brute-force protection** on login pages or allowing weak passwords (e.g., **password123**).
   - **Security Tip**: Enforce strong password policies and protect against brute-force attacks using mechanisms like account lockout or CAPTCHA.

#### 8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**
   - **Definition**: This relates to failure to protect the integrity of software and data from unauthorized changes.
   - **Example**: Not using **digital signatures** or **cryptographic hashes** to verify the integrity of files or software.
   - **Security Tip**: Implement integrity controls like cryptographic hashing to ensure data or software hasnâ€™t been tampered with. For example, checking hash values when downloading software.

#### 9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
   - **Definition**: This refers to the absence of proper logging and monitoring, making it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents.
   - **Impact**: Without adequate logging, detecting and investigating breaches becomes very difficult, both proactively and reactively.
   - **Security Tip**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect unusual behavior and potential breaches.

#### 10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
   - **Definition**: This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can manipulate the server into making requests to unintended locations.
   - **Impact**: SSRF attacks can lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, services, or networks.
   - **Security Tip**: Implement strong **input validation** and sanitize all client input data. Enforce allowed URL schemas and port destinations to prevent unauthorized requests.

### Conclusion

The OWASP Top 10 list provides a comprehensive overview of the most critical security risks for web applications, and it serves as a useful reference for developers, security professionals, and organizations. It is important to familiarize yourself with these risks and address them in your development and security practices.
