### CIS Controls

**CIS Controls** (formerly known as **SANS Top 20**) are a set of **critical security controls** provided by **CIS (Center for Internet Security)**. As of today, the list consists of **18 critical security controls** aimed at securing organizations and their data.

#### Purpose of CIS Controls:
The CIS Controls are **general, high-level best practices** for securing an organization's IT environment, rather than being highly specific like the **CIS Benchmarks** (which are focused on specific configuration settings for various products and systems).

The CIS Controls serve as a **guideline** for organizations to follow in order to improve their overall cybersecurity posture.

#### Key Features of CIS Controls:
- **High-level security practices**: Unlike the more granular CIS Benchmarks, which may focus on specific configurations (e.g., a particular setting in an operating system), the CIS Controls provide a broader set of **best practices** that apply across an organization's entire security program.
- **Top 18**: The current list of CIS Controls is composed of **18 security controls** that cover a wide range of essential security tasks and areas.

#### Overview of CIS Controls:
Here is a brief overview of the **CIS Controls**, grouped by key areas:

1. **Inventory of Enterprise Assets**: Ensure that you have a complete **inventory of your assets**, including hardware and network devices.
   
2. **Inventory of Software Assets**: Similarly, ensure that you know exactly what software is running on your systems. Without this knowledge, securing your environment becomes very difficult.

3. **Protection Policies**: Develop and implement policies around the protection of both hardware and software assets.

4. **Secure Configuration**: Ensure that your assets (e.g., servers, workstations) are configured securely, in line with best practices and security standards.

5. **Account Management**: Implement and enforce policies around **account management**, including user access control, credential management, and role-based access.

6. **Access Control Policies**: Establish strong **access control policies** to govern who can access which systems and resources.

The controls themselves are broad and **high-level**, but they aim to cover the most essential security practices that every organization should be implementing.

#### How to Use CIS Controls:
The CIS Controls provide a roadmap for organizations to follow in order to improve their cybersecurity posture. They act as **guidelines** to identify and address critical areas of security risk across an organizationâ€™s infrastructure.

- While the **CIS Benchmarks** give highly specific, configuration-based guidelines, **CIS Controls** offer a more holistic, organization-wide approach.
- You can find more **detailed guidance** and recommendations for each control on the CIS website, where they provide additional resources to help implement and test these controls.

#### Conclusion:
The **CIS Controls** are a set of essential, high-level best practices that every organization should follow to improve its overall security posture. By following these controls, organizations can ensure that they are covering the key areas needed to protect their data and systems from cyber threats.
