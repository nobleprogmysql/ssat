### 1. **Key Security Principles Overview**

- **Introduction**
  - It is important to understand key security principles if you are studying for security certifications or working within **DevSecOps**.
  - These principles form the foundation for a strong **DevSecOps** or **cybersecurity** program.
  - Throughout this course, key principles will be emphasized, and it is vital to understand them for both certification and practical security implementation.

### 2. **Defense in Depth**

- **What is Defense in Depth?**
  - Defense in Depth is the concept of never relying on a single layer of security but instead using multiple layers to secure a system.
  - This principle is not exclusive to information security; it has been historically used in military strategy.
  
- **Historical Example: Castles**
  - A familiar implementation of **Defense in Depth** is seen in the design of castles throughout history.
  - Castles were built with multiple layers of defense, such as walls, moats, and towers, to protect inhabitants from attackers.
  - If one layer failed, another layer could provide protection. For example, if an attacker crossed the moat, they would still have to get past the castle walls and avoid archers.
  
- **Application in Information Security**
  - In the context of **information security**, Defense in Depth involves using multiple layers of security measures to protect data and systems.
  - For example, on a login page:
    - **Strong password requirements**
    - **CAPTCHA** (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart) to prevent bots
    - **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, such as entering a code sent to a device
    - **Email confirmation** when logging in from a new IP or country
  - These layers of defense ensure that even if user credentials are compromised, the attacker would still face several other hurdles, making it difficult to gain unauthorized access.
  
- **Diagram Representation**
  - A typical **Defense in Depth** diagram includes multiple layers of security:
    - Something you **know** (e.g., username and password)
    - Something you **are** (e.g., geographic location)
    - Something you **have** (e.g., a 2FA code)

### 3. **Least Privilege**

- **What is Least Privilege?**
  - The principle of **Least Privilege** dictates that everything within an environment must have the **minimum necessary access** required to complete its task or purpose.
  
- **Example of Least Privilege**
  - A **service account** running on a machine does not need to have **domain admin** access.
  - For example, a **web server** service account should be restricted to specific permissions, such as **read-only** access to files or databases.
  - It does **not** need full administrative privileges.

- **Why is Least Privilege Important?**
  - The goal is to ensure that an attacker who compromises a service account cannot gain full access to the entire system.
  - If a service account is sufficiently restricted, even if an attacker gains control of it, their ability to exploit the system will be limited.

### 4. **Authorization vs. Authentication**

- **Understanding Authentication**
  - **Authentication** refers to verifying the identity of a user or system. This process ensures that the entity attempting to access the system is who they say they are.
  
- **Understanding Authorization**
  - **Authorization**, on the other hand, determines what the authenticated user or system is allowed to do once their identity is confirmed.
  - Just because a user is authenticated does not mean they are authorized to perform every action within an application.

- **Key Difference**
  - **Authentication** is about confirming the identity of a user (e.g., logging in with a username and password).
  - **Authorization** is about controlling what actions an authenticated user can perform within an application or system (e.g., whether the user can read, write, or delete data).

- **Relationship with Defense in Depth and Least Privilege**
  - Authorization is a key component of **Defense in Depth** and **Least Privilege** principles. It restricts access and actions based on the roles and permissions of authenticated users.
