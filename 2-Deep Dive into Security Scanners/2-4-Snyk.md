### 1. **Introduction**
- **Greeting and Overview**  
  "Hello, Security Gurus. Welcome to this new lecture."  
  "In this lecture, we're going to learn about Snyk and its benefits."  
  "So let's see what is Snyk?"

### 2. **What is Snyk?**
- **Overview of Snyk as an Organization**  
  "Snyk is an organization that develops security tools, which are software as a service."  
  "It means that those are available on the cloud, and those security tools help us to secure source code, which is written by the developers within the organization."

### 3. **Key Areas Snyk Secures**
- **source code**  
  "These security tools help us to identify security issues within this source code."  
  "It is also called SAST or static application security testing."
  
- **Open Source and Third-Party Libraries**  
  "Snyk security tools help us to identify security issues within open source or third-party libraries."  
  "A very common example is Log4j, a very high severity issue that was recently identified."  
  "So now Snyk has released a patch for that security issue within Log4j, and now it identifies all those security issues within Log4j as well."  
  "So, that is one example."  
  "This kind of scan is also called as software composition analysis scan."

- **Containers**  
  "Snyk security tools help us to secure containers. Containers can be Docker containers or Kubernetes pods as well."

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
  "So nowadays, most of the applications are moving to the cloud."  
  "And in order to build cloud infrastructure, we are writing code, for example, for AWS we are writing CloudFormation templates and also using Terraform scripts to create infrastructure within AWS, Azure, and other cloud platforms."  
  "So, Snyk helps us to identify configuration issues within the code written in Terraform and other cloud platform templates."
