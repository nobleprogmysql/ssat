### **Introduction**
Hello, security gurus.  
Welcome to this new lecture.  
In this lecture, we are going to talk about **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Scanning** and the various commercial and open-source tools that are used for IaC security scans.

---

### **Understanding Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

Before diving into IaC security scanning, let's first understand what **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) is and its benefits.

- **What is Infrastructure as Code?**  
  Infrastructure as Code refers to using code to create and manage infrastructure. This can include a variety of resources or services such as:
  - Virtual Machines (VMs), also referred to as servers.
  - Networking components (e.g., network interfaces, security groups, subnets).
  
- **Manual Infrastructure Management vs. Automation:**  
  Managing these resources manually (e.g., updating security groups, creating subnets, creating EC2 instances) can be time-consuming. Infrastructure as Code automates these tasks to free up DevOps teams and developers from repetitive work.

- **Benefits of Infrastructure as Code:**  
  - **Automation** of provisioning, configuration, and management of infrastructure.
  - **Consistency** across environments (e.g., development, testing, staging, production) by using the same code for different environments with only minor value changes.
  - **Reduced Risk** of human error, as automation reduces the likelihood of manual mistakes.

- **IaC Deployment Scope:**  
  IaC can be used to manage both cloud infrastructure and physical on-premise servers.

---

### **What is IaC Security Scanning?**

Since IaC involves writing code to provision infrastructure, there can be coding mistakes or security misconfigurations that introduce vulnerabilities.  

- **Purpose of IaC Security Scanning:**  
  IaC Security Scanning is introduced to identify security misconfigurations in the infrastructure code, which can lead to vulnerabilities. These scans help ensure better, safer code and more secure infrastructure.

---

### **Commercial Tools for IaC Security Scanning**

Several commercial tools are available to perform IaC security scans:

1. **Chekov** (from BridgeCrew):  
   - A popular IaC security scanning tool that scans IaC templates for security misconfigurations.

2. **Snyk**:  
   - A multipurpose tool that can be used for Software Composition Analysis (SCA), container security, and IaC security scanning.

3. **Cloud Exploit**:  
   - A tool specifically designed for IaC security scanning.

- **Integration with CI/CD Platforms:**  
  These tools can be integrated into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) platforms for automated scanning.

---

### **Open-Source and Free IaC Security Tools**

There are also free and open-source tools for IaC security scanning:

1. **Chekov (Community Edition)**:  
   - The open-source version of Chekov, available for free use.

2. **Other Free Tools**:  
   - There are other community-driven tools available for scanning IaC security as well.

---

### **Demo and Practical Application**

In the upcoming lectures, we will explore **live demos** of IaC security scanning, including how to use tools like **Chekov** to perform scans in a CI/CD pipeline.

---

### **Understanding BridgeCrew and Chekov**

- **BridgeCrew (SaaS version)**:  
  BridgeCrew is a cloud-based SaaS offering from the BridgeCrew organization. It uses **Chekov** as part of its service to scan IaC templates for vulnerabilities.

- **Chekov (On-premise Utility)**:  
  Chekov can also be downloaded and used as a stand-alone on-premise utility to perform IaC security scans. The on-premise version can be used independently of the BridgeCrew cloud offering.

- **Difference Between Chekov and BridgeCrew**:  
  - **Chekov**: An open-source utility that can be downloaded and run locally.
  - **BridgeCrew**: A SaaS platform offering the same scanning functionality as Chekov, but hosted and managed in the cloud by BridgeCrew.

---

### **Sample Output from BridgeCrew**

Here’s an example of an IaC security scan output from **BridgeCrew**:

- **Terror Code**: A purposely vulnerable IaC code used for testing the scanning process.
- **Sample Vulnerabilities Detected**:  
  The scan detected several misconfigurations in the code that could lead to security issues:
  - **S3 Bucket Versioning**: The S3 bucket in the code had versioning disabled. The recommended action was to enable versioning.
  - **MFA for Deleting S3 Bucket Objects**: The code lacked Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for deleting objects from the S3 bucket. The recommendation was to enable MFA on delete for added security.

- **Other Misconfigurations**:  
  The scan identified various other security misconfigurations that required action.

---

### **Conclusion**

To summarize:

- **Why IaC Security Scanning is Important**:  
  It helps identify security misconfigurations within IaC code that can lead to vulnerabilities in infrastructure.
  
- **Tools for IaC Security Scanning**:  
  There are both commercial tools (like **Chekov** and **Snyk**) and open-source tools available to perform IaC security scans.
  
- **Demo in Upcoming Lectures**:  
  We will be using these tools in upcoming lectures to perform live demos and show you how to integrate IaC security scans into a CI/CD pipeline.

Thank you for watching, and stay tuned for the next lecture.

## Installing Checkov on ubuntu
sudo apt install python3.12-venv
python3 -m venv checkov-env
source checkov-env/bin/activate
pip install checkov
checkov -version

## Create a folder and create a sample terraform resource file with non-compliant resource definition
vi /home/student/checkov-sample-file/main.tf
