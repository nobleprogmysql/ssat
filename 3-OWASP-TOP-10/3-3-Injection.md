### 1. **Introduction**
- **Welcome and Overview:**
  - "Hello security gurus, welcome to this new lecture."
  - In this lecture, we will learn about the third OWASP Top Ten vulnerability: *Injection*.
  
---

### 2. **Understanding Injection**
- **What is Injection?**
  - Injection can take various forms, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), code injection, and others.
  
- **Common Injection Attacks:**
  - Some of the most widely used injection attacks by attackers are:
    - **SQL Injection**
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    - **Code Injection**
    - And more…

- **How Injection Vulnerabilities Arise:**
  - The application becomes vulnerable to injection in the following scenarios:
    1. **User Input Not Filtered:**
       - If user-supplied input is not sanitized or validated by the application, the application is vulnerable to injection attacks.
    2. **Non-Parameterized Queries:**
       - If the application uses non-parameterized calls (e.g., directly concatenating user input into SQL queries), it can lead to injection vulnerabilities.

---

### 3. **Examples of Injection Vulnerabilities**
- **Example of SQL Query Vulnerability:**
  - A typical vulnerable SQL query might look like this:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = 'password';
    ```
  - In this example, the password input is directly concatenated into the query. This means that user input is directly inserted into the query without proper sanitization or parameterization, making it vulnerable to injection.

### 4. **Live Example: Injection in OWASP Juice Shop**
- **Navigating to the Juice Shop Application:**
  - Now let's see a live example of injection in the *OWASP Juice Shop* application, which is a training platform for security testing.
  - Go to the Juice Shop documentation website under the "Injection" section to explore the challenges related to this vulnerability.

- **Challenge: Login as Admin Using Injection:**
  - In the Juice Shop, there is a challenge that involves logging in as an admin user by exploiting an injection vulnerability.
  - To test this, we’ll use SQL injection payloads.

### 5. **Demonstrating SQL Injection in OWASP Juice Shop**
- **Using SQL Injection Payloads:**
  - Let's test the Juice Shop login page to see if it is vulnerable to SQL injection.
  - Here are some SQL injection payloads:
    1. **Single Quote (`'`)**:
       - A single quote breaks the SQL query syntax, making it vulnerable to injection.
    2. **OR 1=1**:
       - This condition is always true, and can be used to bypass authentication or pull data from the database.
    3. **Hyphen (`--`)**:
       - Used to comment out the rest of the query, which can be used to ignore conditions (like password checks).
  
- **Testing the Injection:**
  - Paste the payload into the login form and click "Login".
  - The payload successfully logs the user in as the admin in the Juice Shop application.

- **Why This Works:**
  - The SQL injection works because the application is using non-parameterized queries where user input is directly concatenated into the SQL query.

### 6. **Remediation and Prevention of Injection Vulnerabilities**
- **Prevention Steps:**
  1. **Use Parameterized Queries:**
     - The best way to prevent injection is by using parameterized queries (prepared statements).
     - Example of a parameterized query:
       ```python
       query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
       cursor.execute(query, (username, password))
       ```
     - Here, `?` placeholders are used for the user input, which is validated before being inserted into the query.
  
  2. **Implement Server-Side and Client-Side Input Validation:**
     - Both server-side and client-side input validation should be implemented to ensure that malicious inputs are filtered out before they reach the application logic.
  
  3. **Use SQL Controls to Limit Exposure:**
     - In the event of an injection attack, use SQL controls like `LIMIT` to restrict the number of rows returned by the query.
     - For example, if a query returns 100 rows, but `LIMIT 1` is used, only one row will be returned, reducing the impact of the attack.

- **Example of Limiting SQL Results:**
  - Example of using `LIMIT` to prevent large-scale data exposure in the event of SQL injection:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? LIMIT 1;
    ```

### 7. **Conclusion**
- **Recap:**
  - In this lecture, we learned about the *Injection* vulnerability from the OWASP Top Ten.
  - We saw how injection can occur through improper handling of user input, such as direct concatenation into SQL queries.
  - A live demonstration showed how an SQL injection could be used to log in as an admin in the Juice Shop application.
  - Finally, we discussed several preventive measures, including using parameterized queries, input validation, and SQL controls like `LIMIT`.

- **Closing Remarks:**
  - "I hope you have enjoyed this lecture. Thanks for watching. See you in the next lecture."
