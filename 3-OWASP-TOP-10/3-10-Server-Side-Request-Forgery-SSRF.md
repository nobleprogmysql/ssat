### 1. Introduction  
- **Greeting and Lecture Overview**  
  "Hello, security gurus. Welcome to this new lecture."  
  "In this lecture we are going to learn about the last OWASP top ten vulnerability, which is server-side request forgery."  
  "So let's jump into the action now."

### 2. Understanding Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)  
- **Definition of SSRF**  
  "Server-side request forgery is a web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to make the application send a request to an unexpected destination even when protected by a firewall, VPN or another type of network access control list."  
  "It means that the attacker is able to compromise the application to send a request to a particular destination on the attacker's behalf."

- **Mechanism of SSRF**  
  "So basically that application is in control of that attacker and whatever URL the attacker will create, the application will send the request to that particular URL without filtering and will return the response."

- **Example of SSRF**  
  "In this case, for example, the attacker crafts a URL to access the admin panel, and the website returns the response on the attacker's behalf."  
  "So basically, in this case, the application returned the information from the server without validating the URL."

### 3. Common Examples of Server-Side Request Forgery  
- **Localhost or Internal IP Exploitation**  
  "A typical example of a full surface where the attacker replaces the server URL with localhost (127.0.0.1) or internal IP (192.168.0.1) to access the local file system on the server."  
  "For example, the local IP address followed by a file name means that the attacker is able to access server locations by modifying the URL to the localhost or server IP address."  
  "It's similar to accessing a local application."

- **Example of Exploiting a Local File**  
  "So, if you see the URL here is not of the web application but of the local server in this case, and then there is a file name, it means that the server that has been compromised because of SSRF attack by the attacker will use the localhost URL to search for this file name and will return it to the attacker."

- **Partial SSRF Attacks**  
  "This is a suitable example of server-side request forgery, similarly partial SSRF attacks where the attacker gets a limited response from the server and will try to send such a request within the URL, like putting the file into its host to see the contents of that file."

- **XREF Attack**  
  "Now, an XREF attack is a type of attack where the attacker controls the IP address and ports of the server and sends requests such as example.com:1337."  
  "It means that the attacker is trying to access some port of that server, which has been compromised because of SSRF attack."

### 4. Practical Example: SSRF in OWASP Juice Shop  
- **Challenge Setup**  
  "Now, let's see this in action. In Juice Shop, we will try to access one server URL by using the localhost IP address."  
  "So we will use the localhost IP address to solve one of the challenges."  
  "And if we're able to use this localhost IP address, it means that the server is vulnerable to server-side request forgery."

- **Accessing the OWASP Juice Shop Website**  
  "Let's switch to OWASP Juice Shop website."  
  "I am on OWASP Juice Shop documentation website, and you can see there is a SSRF challenge where we are requesting a hidden resource on the server through the server."  
  "It means that we will use the localhost IP address while accessing a resource on this server."

- **Login and Exploration of the Application**  
  "So first, we need to log into the web application. And I will log into the web application."  
  "As you can see, I'm logged into the web application."  
  "Now let's access the profile page."  
  "I'll type profile."  
  "Now here you will see one interesting URL, which is an image URL."  
  "It means that we can put some URL of a particular image, and it will become our user profile."

- **Testing with an Image URL**  
  "So one of the URLs which I will put is this one: PlaceKitten."  
  "Let me open this in a new tab and see what it looks like."  
  "So this is a kitten image that will be set as our profile."

- **Inspecting the Network Activity**  
  "Let's click on 'Link Image.'"  
  "I'll put this URL and I'll click on 'Link Image,' and you can see that our image has been updated."  
  "Now, if I go into inspect mode and I go to network, let me put this URL again and click on 'Link Image.'"  
  "You will see that the image has been downloaded into the assets Public image upload."  
  "It means that the server directly downloaded this image and placed it in the server location where it has been stored under images."

- **Resolution of SSRF Challenge**  
  "So in order to resolve this challenge, we also need to access a server URL."  
  "So in order to access this server URL, that URL will be found by downloading malware on this particular server."  
  "So in order to download that malware, there is a malware provided by Juice Shop, which is 'malware_windows_64.3.'"

- **Executing the Attack**  
  "We need to use this malware to make an attack and to access a URL from this server, which is this URL where it says that we will try to access using localhost."  
  "Once we paste this URL in the image URL textbox, we will solve the challenge with this key."

- **Uploading Malware to the Server**  
  "Once the malware will be uploaded, we need to execute that malware on this server and then we will receive this URL."  
  "After that, we need to link it with that image."  
  "Once done, we need to go back to our homepage, and this will result in resolving the challenge, which is an XSS attack."

### 5. Remediation Steps to Prevent SSRF  
- **Sanitize and Validate Client Input**  
  "Some of the preventive measures that we can take to make sure that our application is not vulnerable to server-side request forgery are to sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data."  
  "That is very important. If the client is supplying some input to the web application, it should be sanitized or validated before executing it on the server."

- **Enforce URL Schema and Destination Allow List**  
  "Then we need to enforce the URL schema, port, and destination with a positive allow list."  
  "It means that if the user is submitting a URL which is making the web application make a call outside the web application, to some other domain like Google.com, we need to make sure that the web application does not make that call unless Google.com is whitelisted from our web application."

- **Check for Ports and Disable Redirections**  
  "Similar checks should be implemented for the port."  
  "Then we need to disable all HTTP redirections."  
  "So basically, any redirection from one web application to another should not be done without proper checks."

- **Implement Authentication for Internal Services**  
  "Then we need to implement authentication on internal services so that internal services of the server should not be accessed by the hacker."

- **Use Firewalls for Additional Protection**  
  "Then we have firewalls in place where preventive mechanisms can be provided by those firewalls for self attacks."
