Certainly! Below is the transcript you provided, organized into logical sections for easier readability:

### 1. **Introduction**
Hello security gurus, welcome to this new lecture.

In this lecture we are going to learn about the fourth OWASP top ten vulnerability, which is **insecure design**.

So let's jump into the action.

---

### 2. **What is Insecure Design?**

Now let's first understand what is insecure design.

**Insecure design** is the result of ineffective control design or missing best practices from the application design. It means that an application has been designed, but the best practices while developing that application have been completely missed. So that's why these vulnerabilities appear in that application.

A secure design can also have implementation defects, but the issue with the insecure design is that it **cannot be fixed by perfect security control implementation**. It means that we can still fix secure design by implementing security controls, but **an insecure design cannot be fixed by implementing security controls**. So it is very difficult to fix such an insecure or ineffective design.

---

### 3. **Common Vulnerabilities from Insecure Design**

Let's see some common examples of vulnerabilities that appear when an application is affected by insecure design:

- **Unprotected storage of credentials**: In applications with insecure design, credentials are either unprotected or can be easily leaked.
  
- **Error messages that expose sensitive information**: Error messages that are generated or returned back to the user contain sensitive information, which can lead to **sensitive information disclosure**. Applications vulnerable to insecure design are very prone to this type of vulnerability.

---

### 4. **Practical Example: OWASP Juice Shop**

Let's see that in practice on the **OWASP Juice Shop** application, where insecure design can lead to sensitive information disclosure.

I will first switch to the **OWASP Juice Shop documentation** for challenges related to sensitive data exposure due to insecure design.

---

#### 4.1 **Juice Shop Documentation**

This is the sensitive data exposure page on the OWASP Juice Shop documentation, where we see that due to insecure design, the Juice Shop is vulnerable to sensitive data exposure. These are the challenges available, but we have selected one challenge from this list: the **confidential document leak**, where we can access confidential documentation because of insecure design in the application.

---

#### 4.2 **Accessing the Vulnerability in Juice Shop**

Now let's switch to the OWASP Juice Shop application that we deployed on our local system.

This is the OWASP Juice Shop application deployed locally. If you search around in the application, you will find the **About Us** menu option. I'll click on it.

Once we click on it, we see that there is an **About Us** option where we can read about the developer information and other details about this application.

Let's click on it.

You will see this page. If you look carefully, there is a link that says "checkout are boring. Terms of use." If you are interested in such lame stuff, they want to share more information.

Let's click on it.

You will see a document with legal information. Now, within this document, there is no sensitive information, but if you look at the URL, you will see that it has suddenly changed. The URL now points to an **FTP location** containing this legal information as an **MD file**.

This means if we just remove **legal.md** from the URL, we should be able to see all the files in the FTP location.

Let's do that.

I'll remove **legal.md** from the URL and hit **Enter**.

As you can see, we now see all the files present in the FTP folder. This is a serious issue. No user should be able to access this location without the required permissions just by modifying the URL.

---

#### 4.3 **Identifying Sensitive Files**

Let's see what sensitive files are available here.

If we look carefully, there is a file called **coupons.back**, which is a backup file of a SQL server. There's also an **acquisitions.md** file. This file appears to be related to acquisitions, and likely contains some financial or shareholder information.

Let's click on it.

It says that this is some planned acquisition. The document is confidential and should not be distributed because it contains shareholder information.

This is confidential information, and we were able to access it because of insecure design in the OWASP Juice Shop application. This is an example of sensitive data exposure caused by insecure design.

---

#### 4.4 **Challenge Resolution**

Since we've accessed the confidential documentation, it means that we've resolved the challenge. 

Let's verify this by going back to the home page of the application to see if the challenge has been marked as completed.

As you can see, I have accessed the **OWASP Juice Shop login page** again, and it confirms that we have successfully solved the challenge, which was to access the confidential document.

So, that's how insecure designs can result in sensitive data exposure in such applications.

---

### 5. **Prevention and Remediation Steps**

Now let's look at some **remediation or prevention steps** to ensure that applications are designed securely and do not suffer from insecure design.

---

#### 5.1 **Secure SDLC Lifecycle**

One of the key prevention steps is to follow a **Secure SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)** where application security professionals are integrated into the development process from the start. Security professionals should be involved from the beginning to make sure security practices are considered throughout the development process.

---

#### 5.2 **Threat Modeling**

There should be **threat modeling** implemented in the early stages of the software development lifecycle. In brief, threat modeling is the process of identifying missing security controls in an application and understanding the potential threats the application may face.

---

#### 5.3 **Security User Stories**

Security user stories should be implemented alongside the regular development user stories. This ensures that security and development teams work in parallel to make sure that the application is designed with security in mind.

---

#### 5.4 **Unit Testing and Integration Testing**

**Unit tests** should be written to check each individual module within the application, while **integration tests** are written to test how modules interact with each other. Both types of tests are important to ensure the integrity of the application's security design.

---

#### 5.5 **Resource Limitation**

Resource consumption by users or services should be limited to ensure the application does not face resource exhaustion or other performance-related vulnerabilities. Limiting resource consumption follows the best principles of secure design.

---

### 6. **Conclusion**

So these are some of the prevention steps to ensure that applications are securely designed and not vulnerable to insecure design issues.

I hope you have enjoyed this lecture.

Thanks for watching.

See you in the next lecture.
