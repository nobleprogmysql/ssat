### 1. Introduction
- **Opening Remarks**: "Hello security gurus. Welcome to this new lecture."
- **Topic Introduction**: "In this lecture we are going to deep dive into OWASP top ten sixth vulnerability, which is vulnerable and outdated components."
- **New Entry in OWASP Top Ten**: "This is a new entry into the OWASP top ten and it's quite popular as well."

### 2. What is Vulnerable and Outdated Components?
- **Definition**: "Vulnerable and outdated components in an application, web servers, APIs, and database servers can result in data exposure and can put the entire application or servers at risk."
- **Examples of Risk**:
  - "If you are not sure what versions of components are being used on the client side and server side, then it's quite possible that your application or your server might be at risk."
  - "If the software is unsupported or out of date, there are vulnerable libraries present on that software."
  - "There are outdated libraries which have not been updated as per the security patches released for them, making the software quite vulnerable."
  - "If we do not perform regular security scans for vulnerabilities, this can also put our application at risk."
  - **Lack of Dependency Management**: "If we do not upgrade or fix the dependencies that are vulnerable within the application on a regular basis, it's quite possible that our application is at risk."
  - **Developer Practices**: "If the software developers do not test the compatibility of libraries or they do not check for upgraded libraries, they just pick any version of the old library instead of checking for the newer version, this can also result in putting the application at risk."
- **Common Thread**: "In all these examples, if we have vulnerable libraries or outdated libraries in our application, it's quite possible that our application or server will be at risk."

### 3. Practical Example of Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- **Introduction to Practical Example**: "Now let's see this in a practical example where we will try to solve the outdated component challenge in OWASP Juice Shop."
- **Objective**: "We will try to find the outdated library which is vulnerable in OWASP Juice Shop and then report it."

#### 3.1. Accessing the OWASP Juice Shop Vulnerable Component Challenge
- **Navigating to Challenge**: "So let's first go to the OWASP Juice Shop documentation page related to Vulnerable and Outdated Component challenge."
- **Challenge Overview**: "Here you can see that OWASP has provided many vulnerable component challenges. Let's select one of these challenges."
- **Selected Challenge**: "I will select Vulnerable Library Challenge in this case since the name of this vulnerability is vulnerable component."

#### 3.2. Identifying Vulnerable Libraries in Juice Shop
- **Navigating to the Application**: "Let me switch to OWASP Juice Shop application that we have installed on our local system."
- **Accessing the Application**: "I am on OWASP Juice Shop web application. Let's go to the side menu. Let's click on the About Us page. Let's click on this link 'Check out our boring terms of use.'"
- **FTP Location Access**: "As you can see in the previous lectures, we accessed FTP location of this website. By modifying the URL, I will again modify this URL and go to FTP location."
- **Identifying Package.json File**: "Here you can see multiple files present here, and one of the files, which is very important and will contain the library information that is being used by the application, is `package.json`."
  - **Explanation**: "Now let me explain why this file will contain the library information: `package.json` is a standard file used in Node.js applications. Node.js applications define all the libraries in `package.json`. Similarly, in Java applications, we define all the libraries in `pom.xml`."
- **Attempting to Download the File**: "Now we will have to download this file. When we click on this file, we see that there is an error saying 'only .md and .pdf files are allowed.'"
- **Exploit: Null Byte Injection**: "Since this is a vulnerable application, OWASP Juice Shop is also vulnerable to null byte injection, a method to avoid any kind of filters being implemented by the application."
  - **Null Byte Injection**: "So in a null byte injection exploit, we try to add this exploit at the end of the file name to bypass the filter."
  - **Execution**: "I will copy this and I will paste it here. And I will hit enter. And as you can see, we have successfully downloaded the file."

#### 3.3. Analyzing Vulnerable Libraries
- **Opening and Inspecting `package.json`**: "I will open this file and you can see that we have successfully downloaded this file. I will zoom in."
  - **Dependencies Overview**: "Now if I scroll down, you will see that all the dependencies of this Node.js application are defined here."
- **Checking for Vulnerable Libraries**: "Now, our next step is to find a vulnerable library here."
- **Using Snyk for Vulnerability Scanning**:
  - **Accessing Snyk**: "In order to find whether this library is vulnerable or not, we will use a website called Snyk vulnerability database."
  - **Searching for Libraries**: "Let's click on it. Here you can find a search box."
  - **Library Search Example**: "Let me copy the first library name `body-parser` and paste it here. Hit enter."
    - **NPM Module Selection**: "Let's select npm module since we are just checking for Node.js libraries."
    - **Vulnerability Scan Result**: "As you can see, there is a prototype pollution vulnerability related to `body-parser` XML, and this is applicable to all the versions less than 2.0.3."
    - **Conclusion on Body-Parser**: "In our case, we are using a vulnerable version which is 1.18."
  - **Further Library Checks**: "Similarly, let's copy `colors` dependency name and paste it here. Hit enter. You will see that there are a number of vulnerabilities associated with it."
    - **Denial of Service Vulnerability**: "Let's open denial of service vulnerability. And you will notice that it is only applicable to versions greater than 1.4.0."
    - **Conclusion on Colors**: "In our case, we are using 1.1. It means that the version that we are using is not vulnerable."
  - **Identifying the Vulnerable Library**:
    - "The vulnerable library name is `Mars DB`."
    - **Searching for Mars DB**: "I will copy it. I will switch back to Snyk vulnerability database and I will paste it here."
    - **Vulnerability in Mars DB**: "You can see that there is an arbitrary code injection vulnerability associated with this library."
    - **Critical Severity**: "It is a very critical vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8."

#### 3.4. Reporting the Vulnerability
- **Reporting via Customer Feedback**: "Now that we have found the vulnerable library, let's go back to OWASP Juice Shop website."
- **Navigating to Report Section**: "I'll go back to the home page. I'll click on the side menu. Now the final step is to report this vulnerability."
  - **Filling in the Report**: "We need to report it using the 'Customer Feedback' option."
  - **Vulnerability Report**: "I'll copy the name of the library and I will paste it in the comment section. Also, I will copy the version of the library which is 0.6."
  - **Adding Another Vulnerable Library**: "The second library name, which was vulnerable, was `express JWT` with version 0.1.3."
- **Final Report Submission**: "Let's put the rating and captcha, and click on submit."
  - **Challenge Completion**: "And you can see that we have successfully solved a challenge which is reporting a vulnerable library in the application."

### 4. Remediation and Prevention Steps
- **Software Composition Analysis**:
  - "We need to perform software composition analysis, security scans for third-party libraries using tools like OWASP Dependency Check, Snyk, or similar tools."
  - **Purpose of Software Composition Analysis**: "This helps us to find vulnerable libraries present in our application and provides recommendations about fixing those vulnerable libraries."
  - **Regular Security Scans**: "These security scans should be regularly performed on our applications."
- **Removing Unused Dependencies**: "Unused dependencies, libraries, components, and files should be removed from the application as well as the server."
- **Avoiding Unofficial Sources**: "Downloading components, libraries from unofficial sources should be avoided, and only official sources should be used using secure links."
  - **Example Repositories**: "For example, Node.js has the npm registry, and Java uses the Maven repository."

### 5. Conclusion
- **Summary of Key Points**: "So this was all about vulnerable and outdated components vulnerability in OWASP top ten."
- **Understanding the Vulnerability**: "I hope you can now understand why this vulnerability was mentioned in OWASP top ten and why it occurs."
- **Practical Demonstration**: "We saw the practical steps of how to identify it, and we also saw the safety measures to avoid such vulnerabilities in our application or servers."
- **Closing Remarks**: "I hope you have enjoyed this lecture. Thanks for watching. See you in the next lecture."
