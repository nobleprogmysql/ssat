### 1. Introduction
- **Greeting and Lecture Introduction**  
  "Hello, security gurus. Welcome to this new lecture."

- **Overview of the Vulnerability**  
  "In this lecture we are going to learn about the ninth vulnerability in OWASP top ten list, which is security, logging and monitoring failures."

- **Start of the Discussion**  
  "So let's jump into the action."

### 2. Understanding Security, Logging, and Monitoring Failures
- **Definition and Importance**  
  "Security, logging and monitoring refers to logging, important information and continuous monitoring. It helps to detect, escalate and respond to security breaches."

- **Consequences of Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**  
  "Now, insufficient or missing logging can result in the inability to handle such events. It means that if you have proper security, logging and monitoring implemented on your server or your infrastructure, in case any security incident happens, you will be able to go through all the logs that have been stored to understand how this incident happened, secure those logs and then take appropriate action."

- **Continuous Monitoring**  
  "Similarly, if you have continuous monitoring implemented on your infrastructure, that will generate some alerts in case any hacker will try to hack your infrastructure or will try to send some illegal request to your application."

### 3. Common Examples of Security, Logging, and Monitoring Failures
- **Missing Logging and Triggering Events**  
  "Now let's see some common examples of security, logging and monitoring failures. Now, if continuous logging failures are happening and those are not being logged and triggers are not being initiated on such field events, then it's a failure related to security, logging and monitoring."

- **Unclear Log Messages**  
  "Similarly, if warnings and errors are generated, but they do not contain any useful information and those are very unclear log messages that also will result in security, logging and monitoring failure."

- **Lack of Monitoring Suspicious Activities**  
  "Then, if the logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activities, for an example, if bulk of requests are being sent to an application to bring that application down resulting in denial of service attack, if such events are not being monitored, then it will result in security, logging and monitoring failure."

- **Storing Logs Locally without Backup**  
  "If we are storing logs locally, we are not backing it up on another server. This will also result in such kind of failures because we need to make backup of such logs in case a security incident happened."

- **No Alerting or Escalation Mechanism**  
  "Alerting thresholds are not in place and there is no escalation mechanism in case of security incident. Then this will also result in security, logging and monitoring failure."

- **Inadequate Alerts from Dynamic Testing Tools**  
  "And finally, if testing and scans by dynamic application security testing tools do not generate any alerts, then this means that there is inadequate security, logging or monitoring happening. When dynamic assessment tools will start sending requests to an application, it should generate alerts as huge amount of load will be sent to that application."

- **Failure to Trigger Alerts**  
  "If we have proper logging and monitoring in place for that application, it will generate alerts that a number of requests are coming from this particular IP address and an action should be taken. But in case such alerts are not being triggered, it means that there is a failure in implementing logging and monitoring."

### 4. Remediation and Preventive Measures
- **Logging of Access Control Failures**  
  "We need to make sure that all the login access control server side input validation failures are properly logged with sufficient details so that in case tomorrow there is a security incident, forensic analysis can be performed by using those logs."

- **Log Format and Management**  
  "Similarly, we need to make sure that logs are generated in a format that it can be submitted to a log management solution as well. Like Splunk, it's a very popular tool. It's a SIEM tool that is being used these days."

- **Log Data Encoding**  
  "We need to make sure that log data is encoded correctly to prevent any kind of injection attacks."

- **Audit Trails for High-Value Transactions**  
  "Then we need to make sure that high value transactions have proper audit trail with integrity controls to prevent tampering or deletion. Now, a high value transaction, for an example, can be a banking transaction or it can be a credit card transaction."

- **Effective Monitoring and Alerting Systems**  
  "Finally, teams should establish effective monitoring and alerting systems so that in case there are suspicious activities happening within the application, teams can quickly respond to it."

### 5. Conclusion
- **Recap of Security, Logging, and Monitoring Failures**  
  "I hope you have understood now the ninth vulnerability in OWASP top ten list, which is security, logging and monitoring failures."

- **Closing Remarks**  
  "I hope you enjoyed this lecture. Thanks for watching."
