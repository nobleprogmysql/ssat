### 1. Introduction
- **Greeting and Lecture Introduction**  
  "Hello security gurus, welcome to this new lecture."

- **Overview of the Vulnerability**  
  "In this lecture we are going to learn about the eighth vulnerability listed in OWASP top ten category, which is software and data integrity failures."

- **Start of the Discussion**  
  "So let's jump into the action and learn about this vulnerability."

### 2. Understanding Software and Data Integrity Failures
- **Introduction to the New Category**  
  "Now software and Data integrity Failure is a new category introduced into OWASP top ten, which is related to software updates, CI, CD pipelines, plugins, modules or library updates."

- **Cause of the Failures**  
  "Now these failures occur when such kind of libraries or plugins are downloaded from untrusted sources."

- **Example with Maven**  
  "For an example, if we try to download a maven library not from the official maven repo, then it can result in such kind of failures."

- **Example with NodeJS**  
  "Similarly, if we are working on NodeJS application and we are downloading Node.js libraries or modules from untrusted website instead of the official npm website, it will also result in such kind of integrity failures."

- **Insecure CI/CD Pipelines**  
  "Another example is when we have insecure CI CD pipelines, where the access is not properly implemented and can result in unauthorized access to the code present in that CI CD pipeline. This will also result in software and data integrity failure."

### 3. Common Examples of Software and Data Integrity Failures
- **Untrusted Sources for Libraries and Dependencies**  
  "As I mentioned, if the libraries or dependencies are not downloaded from the official sources, then such failures can happen."

- **Vulnerable Components or Libraries**  
  "If the components or libraries contain vulnerabilities and those libraries are not scanned for security vulnerabilities, such failures can occur."

- **Lack of Code Review Process**  
  "Similarly, if there is no review process for the code, then this can also introduce such failures within our application."

### 4. Preventive Measures
- **Use of Official Repositories**  
  "Some of the preventive measures that we can take are libraries and dependencies such as maven dependencies or NodeJS modules should be downloaded only from the official repos."

- **Official Repositories for Maven and NodeJS**  
  "We have maven repo, which is the official repo for any kind of Maven dependency. Similarly, we have npm repo which is used to download NodeJS dependencies. We shall always use those websites for downloading such dependencies."

- **Code and Configuration Review Process**  
  "Then there should be a review process for code and configuration changes. This review process will help us to reduce the chances of malicious code or configuration getting into your software pipeline."

- **Role of Security Architects and Software Architects**  
  "If the code is being reviewed by security architects as well as software architects, then there are less chances that a malicious code or wrong configuration can be left into the software pipeline."

- **Data Integrity Checks**  
  "Then unsigned or unencrypted serialized data should not be sent to unknown clients, so there should always be some kind of data integrity check or digital signature mechanism implementation while transferring of data."

- **Dependency Check Tools and Software Bill of Materials**  
  "Then dependency check tool or software bill of materials, which is also called as software composition analysis should be implemented to verify that components, libraries or modules do not have any vulnerabilities."

- **Importance of Vulnerability Scans**  
  "This is very important. As such kind of scans which are sperm or Rs scans will help us to identify vulnerabilities in third party libraries."

### 5. Conclusion
- **Recap of Software and Data Integrity Failures**  
  "So this was all about software and data integrity failures. Vulnerability in OWASP top ten."

- **Closing Remarks**  
  "I hope you have enjoyed this lecture. Thanks for watching. See you in the next lecture."
